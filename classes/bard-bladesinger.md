# The Bladesinger


Bladesingers are elves who bravely defend their people and lands. They are elf wizards who master a school of sword fighting grounded in a tradition of arcane magic. In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense.

## War and Song

When you adopt this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, the longsword, and the scimitar.

If youâ€™re proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells, provided that you aren't wearing heavy armor or using a shield.

The bladesinger lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a bard spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.



## Bladesong

Starting at 3rd level, you can invoke a secret elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing  heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time you choose (no action required).

Roll your bardic inspiration dice, you gain the following benefits:

* When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

* Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

* You gain temporary hit-points equals to twice the value rolled for your bardic inspiration dice.

* You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).

* You gain advantage to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. 

## Extra Attack

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Steal spell

Starting at 6th level, whenever you counterspell a spell, your next weapon attack does an extra 1d8 per spell level of the countered spell


## Song of Defense

Beginning at 10th level, you can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one bardic inspiration and gain temporary hit points equal to four times the inspiration dice (if you and your DM prefer, roll the dice four times instead). Reduce any damage that you take first from the temporary hit points.
