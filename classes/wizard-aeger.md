# Aegis

While their distant abjurer cousins are masters of magic that blocks, banishes, or protects, the Aegis (or Aeger) dedicate their life to embodying these aspects into a physical being. Through skill and talent, Aegers craft constructs charged with protecting themselves, dungeons, or members of royalty.



## Shield Guardian


At 2nd level, you have learned to weave your magic to create a powerful beign to protect you in battle. 


Provided that you expend one spell slot of 1st level or higher and 10 gp worth of spell components, as part of a short or long rest, you craft a shield guardian.
The shield guardian has a central magical core in the shape of a unique symbol.
You carry a talisman on a staff, necklace, or any other ornament with a similar yet smaller version of that symbol. This wondrous item lets you magically control the guardian.


In combat, the guardian shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. 
It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, or Help action.



## Arcane Trap


At 2nd level, you have learned to weave your magic to create an arcane protective glyph. 

As a bonus action, chose a point within 30 feet of you. You magically ward that location. Whenever a creature starts it turn over an arcane glyph or move to a space occupied by a glyph, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, the creature's speed is halved.



You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.





## Warding Bond


Starting at 6th level, you are magically bonded to the shield guardian. As long as the guardian is within 15 feet of you, you gain +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and you have resistance to non-magical weapon damage. Also, each time you take non-magical weapon damage, the guardian takes the same amount of damage.
This damage cannot be reduced by any means.

##### The crafting of a Shield Guardian

You are encouraged to talk with your DM and discuss any roleplaying aspects to how you create the shield guardian and what materials it is made of. For example, on a shipwreck, you may roleplay that you magically levitate driftwood, sea stones, and rusty iron chains to craft your shield guardian.

The shield guardian can also represent a spirit or fey creature bonded to you by a contract.

## Defensive Grid

Beginning at 10th level, your shield guardian emanates a threatening arcane aura that discourages any creature from approaching its master.

The aura flits around the shield guardian to a distance of 15 feet. 
Any hostile creature in the area has its speed reduced by 10 feet, and when the creature attacks the wizard for the first time on a turn, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, the creature takes force damage equal to your wizard level.
