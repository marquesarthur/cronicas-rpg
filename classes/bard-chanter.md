# The Chanter


Chanters are bards who rely on verbal tradition. Instead of using magic instruments, they rely on their powerful voices and chant rhyms of courage and glory and give them and their allies supernatural strength to overcome any trials or burdens.

<br>



## War and Song

When you adopt this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, the sheidl, and the battle axe.

If you’re proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells, provided that you aren't wearing heavy armor.

Additionally, you learn the Green-flame blade and Booming blade cantrips.


## Battle Chant

Starting at 3rd level, you can expend one use of yout bardic inspiration and you can invoke a secret magic song, provided that you aren't wearing  heavy armor and you can speak. 

You can use a bonus action to start chanting, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced. You can also dismiss chanting at any time you choose (no action required). You start with two songs and you can learn new songs at the 7th and 10th levels.

* **Blessed Was Wengridh, Quickest of His Tribe** up to three friendly creatures of your choice in a 30 feet radius gain extra 5 feet of movement

* **Dull the Edge, Blunt the Point** up to three friendly creatures of your choice in a 30 feet radius gain temporary hit points equal to your charisma modifier.

* **The Dragon Thrashed, The Dragon Wailed** up to three hostile creatures of your choice in a 30 feet radius take psych damage equal to your charisma modifier.

* **Lo, Their Endless Host, the Harbingers Doom** up to three hostile creatures of your choice in a 15 feet radius have their movement speed halved while within 15 feet radius of you.

* **Her Courage Thick as Steel** a friednly creature of your choice in a 30 feet radius has advantage in their next attack roll.

* **The Fox from the Farmer Did Run and Leap** up to three friendly creatures of your choice in a 30 feet radius do not provoke attacks of opportunity for the first 5 feet of their movement.

* **At the Sight of their Comrades, their Hearts Grew Bold** the attacks of a friednly creature of your choice in a 30 feet radius count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

## Song of Wrath

Starting at 6th level, whenever you chant, you start to stockpile raw magic. Your chant starts with one rythm and 
at every turn, you can spend your bonus action and add one extra rythm to your chant. Instead of adding a rythm to your chant, you can spend your action to burn your pool of rythms and evoke one of the following songs:


* **The Thunder Rolled like Waves on Black Seas** up to three hostile creatures of your choice in a 30 feet radius must make a Strength saving throw. A target takes your bardic inspiration dice thunder damage -- per stocked rythm --  on a failed save and is knocked prone, or half as much damage on a successful one and it isn’t knocked prone.


* **The Bride Caught their Ruse and Set to Make them Pay** up to three hostile creatures of your choice in a 30 feet radius must make a Charisma saving throw. A target takes your bardic inspiration dice necrotic damage -- per stocked rythm --  on a failed save and is frightned, or half as much damage on a successful one and it isn’t frightned.

* **Rise Again, Rise Again, Scions of Adon!**  up to three friendly creatures of your choice in a 30 feet radius regain hit points equal to your bardic inspiration dice -- per stocked rythm.

* **Thrice Was She Wronged, and Thrice Justly Avenged** make a melee spell attack -- per stocked rythm -- against a creature within 30 feet of range. Each attack has a bonus to attack rolls equals to the number of stocked rythms. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to your bardic inspiration dice + your charisma modifier.


The DC for some of your songs is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. My intention of using the bardic inspiration dice for damage rolls is to make the class feature competitive with cantrips damage. 




## Secret of Rhymes

Beginning at 10th level, you can change the song/effect of your battle chant at the beggining of your turn (no action required).
