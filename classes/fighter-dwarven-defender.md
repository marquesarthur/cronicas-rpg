# Dwarven Defender


Dwarven defenders are skilled in many ways but the emphasis of their training lies on defense, rather than offense. All dwarven defenders have an extreme capability both for deflecting blows with their armor or shields, as well as for taking any blows that get through. A line of dwarven defenders is a far better defense than a 10-foot-thick wall of stones, and much more dangerous.

## Hold the Line


Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

## Defensive Stance

Starting at 3rd level, you can spend your bonus action and take a defensive stance. When a dwarf defender adopts a defensive stance, they gain phenomenal strength and durability. While on defensive stance:


* You have advantage on all Dexterity saving throws.

* You gain +1 bonus to AC.

* You gain temporary hit-points equals to half your Fighter level.

* Attacks against a single ally that is within 5 feet of you have disadvantage, as you are constantly protecting them.

You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.


## Dwarvish Runes

Starting at 7th level, you enchant your armor and shield with mighty dwarven runes. You can carve up to three runes which remain on an object until you finish a long rest or you activate the rune, dispelling its effect. 



* **Nogrod** you activate this rune as a reaction when you are the target of a spell. You have advantage against the spell save.


* **Dor-Lómin** you activate this rune as a reaction when you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. 

* **Kheled-zâram**  you activate this rune as a reaction when you are hit by an attack. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +4 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack. If the attack misses, you can make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add your Fighter level to the attack's damage roll.


* **Nauglamír** you activate this rune when you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each creature regains an equal amount of hit points.

* **Mîr** you activate this rune as a reaction when a hostile creature moves adjacent to an ally. You immediately move up to your movement speed towards the creature. If you end your movement adjacent to the creature, make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you knock the target prone.


## Living Fortress

Starting at 10th level, you have advantage on initiative rolls.
Additionally, your defensive stance AC bonus increases to +2.
