# Sword Saint

A honorary title given to a warrior of legendary skill in swordsmanship.
The term is considered by some to imply a higher degree of perfection possibly also encompassing a moral dimension. Although there is no such written rule, the title carries such prestige that is commonly understood that there should be no more than one kensei at any given time.

A true samurai has only one judge of his honor, and that is himself. Decisions you make and how those decisions are carried out are a reflection of who you truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.

## Prerequisite


You cannot have a shield as your holy symbol. A sword saint often has his holy symbol tied to the pummel of his sword or wrapped around his hand.



## Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.


**Hallow Weapon.** As a bonus action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive/negative energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, when you score a critical hit with the weapon or use your Divine Smite feature, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.


**Center Stance.** As an bonus action, you gain inner focus and reflexes in combat, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, when a creature hits you with an Attack, you gain your Charisma modifier bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.
