# Deepwood Sniper


An arrow flies from a high mountain aerie, unerringly striking a paladin's mount. Expecting only a flesh wound, the paladin is stunned to watch his companion of many adventures crumple to the earth. This unfortunate knight has trespassed into the domain of the deepwood sniper, and he may not make it out alive.

## Deepwood Magic

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Deepwood Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.



## Eagle's Nest


At 3rd level, climbing no longer costs you extra Movement and you ignore the first 10 feet of fall damage. You are not prone if you take no fall damage due to this class feature.


## Consistent Aim

At 3rd level, you master bowmanship. 

You know how to aim so precisely that you exploit gaps in the armor of a foe. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.


The aim damage die changes when you reach certain Ranger levels.
The die becomes a 2d6 at 7th level and 3d6 at 11th level.




## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Threaten
By 7th level, your reflexes are so accurate that you threaten your surroundings as if you are engaged in melee combat. 

Any creature moving anywhere 10 feet away but not immediately adjacent to you cause attacks of opportunity. You can use a ranged weapon to perform this attack and, in case the attack hits, any feats or benefits applied only to melee weapons apply to your attack.



You can use this feature a number of times equals to your Dexterity modifier. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.



## Slayer Arrow
At 11th level, you can expend one spell slot to magically imbue your quiver. For 1 minute, any arrows that you draw and that you fire from your bow have one of the following slaying effects:


* **Dailir**  Green leaf blade arrows pierce through magical ilusions or protections. Whenever you draw an Dailir arrow, you ignore benefits provided from the shield, invisibility, mirror image or blur spells.


* **Belthronding ** Black sharp arrows pierce through your first target. One creature adjacent to your target takes half your consistent aim damage.

* **Elene** A black-feathered arrow barbed with steel. On a hit, the target speed is reduced by 5 feet until the start of your next turn. This effect is cummulative, e.g., 2 hits would reduce the target speed by a total of 10 feet.
