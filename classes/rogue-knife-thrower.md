# Knife Thrower

The city guard looked about uneasily. Was he seeing things or did a stealthy figure just duck behind that pillar? Suddenly, a dart like object hit the guard in the throat and even as he fell, a figure slipped through the entrance into the treasure room.





## Steady Aim
Starting at 3rd level, attacking at long range with a weapon with the throwing property doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

Additionally, you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.

## Shoulder Bag
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you craft a sturdy leather bag that can hold up to 30 knifes. Knifes stowed in this bag are magically lighter and, at maximum capacity, the bag weights 3.5 lb.

As an action, you can return any number of knifes that you drew from your shoulder bag. With a command, the weapons magically fly through the air and return to your bag. 

Your shoulder bag can absorb the properties of one one-handed Magic Weapon by performing a Special ritual while you study the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. At the end of the ritual, the original weapon is destroyed and any knifes that **you** draw from your shoulder bag have the magical properties of the absorbed magic weapon. You canâ€™t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. 
Whenever you absorb a new item, the properties of the previous one cease to exist.



You reinforce your bag and make it more versatile as you gain Rogue levels. 
At 5th level, the bag can store the properties of up to two magic items and at 8th level, the properties of up to three magic items. You decide which properties a knife drawn from the bag has at the moment you draw it. 


## Deadly Reflexes
Starting at 9th level, you have mastered the art of knife throwing. As a reaction to an enemy moving towards you, you may make a ranged weapon attack. If the attack hits, you may acrobatically tumble 10 feet away from the enemy without provoking an attack of opportunity.

You can use this feature a number of times equals to your Dexterity modifier.
You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.


## Knife Barrage
By 13th level, when you use the Attack action and make a ranged attack with a one handed weapon, make make one additional attack. You automatically draw a throwing weapon for this extra attack.

> ##### Design Note on Deadly Reflexes
>
> This should be the 13th level or even 17th level class Feature as you basically have Dexterity modifier extra sneak attacks per long rest. However, most of my games cap at  10th level. Hence the reason why it is the 9th level class feature.
