# Earthshaker


Druids that mold the earth to their will. An earthshaker has the fury of an earthquake  or the gentleness of drift sand. No one can tell. In battle, an earthshaker uses its druidic magic to create protective stone armour or to barrage enemies with stone pin missiles.








## Prerequisite


The earthshaker circle is exclusive to earth genasi and goliath races. At your DM's discretion, other races are allowed.






## Circle Spells

Your symbiotic link to the earth and soil grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the Geomagnetic Blast cantrip. This cantrip is exclusive to the circle of the earthshaker and no other class or circle can cast it.


At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Earthshaker Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.




## Stone Endurance


At 2nd level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin yet resistant magical armor made of earth and stone. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. 

At 6th level your AC increases to 14 + your Dexterity modifier and at 10th level to 15 + your Dexterity modifier.


## Earth Revenant
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to magically control the environment around you.

As an bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken your earth armor. Rather than transforming into a beast form, stones and debris break from the nearby environment and whirl around you causing damage to attackers and empowering your geomagnetic blast. You gain the following benefits:

* **Stone rebuke:** The first time a creature hits you with an attack in a turn, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your level in this class. 



* **Empowered Blast**: add your Wisdom modifier to the damage of any stone missile of  your geomagnetic blast.


These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.


<div class='descriptive'>
#### Game mechanics:

The stone rebuke damage works similarly to a sneak attack, which means that creatures take this damage if they hit you with attacks of opportunity  or whenever they attack in other creatures' turn.
</div>



## Aftershock


At 6th level, you can further empower your geomagnetic blast with a aftershock effect. 

Once per turn, you may expend a druid spell slot to cause one of your stone missiles to deal extra damage. The extra damage is 1d8 per level of the spell slot, to a maximum of 5d8. 
Additionally, whenever your earth revenant class feature is active, a creature hit by a empowered stone missile must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

| Druid level | Circle Spells*  |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Maximilian’s Earthen Grasp, Shatter |
| 5th | Meld into Stone (Ritual), Slow |
| 7th | Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere, Stoneskin |
| 9th | Bigby’s Hand, Wall of Stone |

<div style="text-align: right;">
Your spell's always have stone and debris effects, e.g., otiluke's sphere might look more like a earth/stone dome *

## Echo Slam


At 10th level, you gain the ability to cause a small earthquake by stomping the ground and channeling your geomagnetic grip through your surroundings. 

As a reaction before an enemy movement or attack roll within 60 feet of you, you cause a shockwave that travels through the ground and hits the target. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked prone. If the target has burrow speed, it makes the roll with disadvantage.


You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.




<div class='descriptive'>
#### Game mechanics:

A prone creature has disadvantage on their attack rolls and it must spend half of its movement to stand up from prone.
</div>




### Spells


#### Geomagnetic Blast
*Druid Cantrip -- Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V,  S
- **Duration:** instantaneous


You use geomagnetic energy to control earth and stone in your surroundings. One or more stone missiles streak toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage.

The spell creates more than one stone missiles when you reach higher levels: two stone missiles at 5th level, three at 11th level, and four stone missiles at 17th level. You can direct the attacks at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each stone missile.
