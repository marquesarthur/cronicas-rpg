# The Silver Marshes


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
  These are the tales of how five or six strangers met and how they made a name for themselves in the Silver Marshes -- an inhospitable place where a small conglomerate of cities is the only light in the middle of the savage lands that cross the icy landscape of the northern frontiers of the Forgotten Realms.

## Muddy and cursed road


It's been one month since the trading caravan of  <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Ragrim Soutale</span> has left the walled Citadel Adbar -- an ancient dwarven fortress under the Ice Mountains in the northwestern corner of the Silver Marches.

The caravan endured several trials until it reached the road called the Fork. It had been attacked by orcs and goblinoids, it had survived the cold autumn weather and constant rain, and its carts had suffered travelling through the muddy and not maintained road.


The precarious conditions of the road made the caravan pay its toll. Two wagons had broken, and they were out of supplies to fix them. Without any options left, Ragim sent the mercenary company that protected the caravan to gather supplies in a small city down the road. Almost five days have passed and what was supposed to be a quick job turned into complaints and curses. The dwarf walked and kicked the broken wagon cursing the incompetence of his hirelings. Without any options left, he asked for volunteers to discover what has happened to the mercenary company and also to assist protect the caravan while they slowly made their way to the small town of <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Dead Snow.</span>

## Six strangers, one goal


While most of the people in the caravan are ordinary salesmen or people moving from one city to another, there are a few that rise among their peers. These notable individuals had at least some first-hand experience facing the perils of an adventurous life. It's not sure how they decided to travel as part of the caravan but they did, and they answered Ragrim's call.

<br>

<span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Bren</span> -- a half-elf archer whose the two adoptive fathers have tought him both the arts of archery and spellcraft. He seeks a mythical bow <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Tahbon</span> that once belonged to one of his fathers;

<br>

<span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Ulfgar Silveraxe</span> -- a dwarven fighter of noble lineage. He refused to follow orders of his ruthless captain earns his life as a sellsword (or axe more precisely);

<br>

<span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Sigmund Teach</span> -- a human pirate who worships the god of sea storms. He lost his crew in a storm and somehow reached the Silver Marches;

<br>

<span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Svart Folkvar</span> -- a human barbarian of the lion clan. He's a skilled blacksmith and seems pretty stoic;

<br>

<span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Eldrin Rake</span> -- an elven wizard trained in the arcane arts of war magic. He is driven by his thirsty for knowledge and fights alongside his owl familiar, <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Edwige</span>

<br>

<span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Mutombo</span> --  a human sellsword from the desert lands to the west of the marshes. Once a slave, he now fights as a freeman

# Dead Snow


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
  Dead snow, the youngest city to join the Silver Marshes city confederate.
  It's known for its mines where precious gems and ore are found. More recently, 
  miners found a large gold veil and ever since, the city faces the troubles and challenges of a gold rush. Its inns are full, and a tent city is growing outside the city walls.  
</span>





## Road to dead snow


The adventurers band together and guide the caravan through the road that leads to Dead Snow. The path can barely be called a road and the rain season turned the road in a steep and slippery path.

Passing through the ruins of a long abandoned entry-post, the adventurers notice a band of goblins riding worgs approaching the caravan. They make a stand and fight the riders. It's a quick combat and the tide is in their favour. 
Soon after, they are cleaning their swords and scavaging any spoils.
Using Edwige as a scout, Eldrin notices a larger group of raiders moving to the mountains to the east. However, the group decides to investigate them only after they finish their business in the city.



During the 3 days of travel to reach the city, the party engages in small errands. 
Sigmund talks with the caravan cooker <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Poppy Warmwater</span> and discover that he is highly suspicious of any pranks by a certain prankster, though he does not who he or she is. Sigmund says that he may be able to help Poppy. Eldrin talks with a bard that travels with the caravan <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Colt Le fleur</span> and asks for any rumors or stories in the region. While Colt is not aware of any rumours other than the gold rush, Eldrin discovers that Colt has a talking cat and he wants to know more about the cat later.
Bren spies Ragrin and discovers that one of the caravan wagons contains a large and well-crafted coffin. Finally, the tailor of the caravan <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Eleanor shy smile</span> approaches Svart. Without much explanation, she asks him to deliver a letter for the head of the city, lady <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Alertha Icespear.</span> Svart accepts the errand.


In the last day before reaching the city, the caravan is ambushed once again. This time, goblins mounted in black bears. The party fights them but soon discover that one of the goblins is a spell caster. This tiny greenish thing tries to dominate Svarts mind and turn him against the rest of the party. Svart resists the spell and when cornered, the small goblin simple vanishes. Eldrin studies the last spell cast by the golbin spell caster and discovers that it is from the school of conjuration, supposing that the goblin teleported to a safer location.

Without any more threats, the caravan passes the tent city around the walls of dead snow and reaches the city gates.

Dead snow is a set of loosely coupled quests originally found in 
the Forgotten Realms supplement "Silver Marches".
I've made a set of changes grabbing things from the "Lost Mine of Phandelver" 
and also introducing my own NPCs as the caravan members.

## City Gates


Reaching the city gates, the adventurers ask for passage. The guard is afraid of letting so many wagons and strangers getting in the city and he goes after his captain. Meanwhile, Ragrin tries to convince another guard to provide them shelter. Soon they enter in a discussion and Ragrin gets pissed. The rude dwarf lowers his pants and pisses in the city gates yelling that the caravan doesn't need the city protection.


## Errands in Dead Snow


The city captain soon comes to the city gates and allows individuals to get in, warning them that law-breakers will be thrown in the city's jail. The adventurers start to gather clues of the whereabouts of the mercenaries sent by Ragrin. They also gather small jobs in the city. The owner of one of the local shops <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Haskar</span> saw the mercenaries. He pointed out that he was out of supplies and that the last items (both supplies and carpentry) were brought by a group of miners. The mercenaries went to the mountains to try their luck with them. Haskar also offers a bounty to the party. He swears that he saw a demon dog in the fields and he and a friend have placed a bet about the beast. If the party finds out the demon dog, they will be rewarded.


Svart goes to the city hall and requests an audience with Alertha. He delivers Eleanor's letter and notices that Alertha is grateful. While Svart is not keen, he manages to convince Alertha that the caravan is not a threat and she will provide a place in the vicinity for them while repairs to the wagons are made and supplies are gathered.

Lastly, Mutombo finds a bounty about a pair of wyverns. The creatures are attacking cattle in the fields, and the league of farmers offer a good reward to whoever slays the beasts.


<br>

With all the gathered information, the adventurers travel to the mines up in the south searching for the missing mercenaries.

<div class='descriptive'>
Reminders:
1. The missing mercenaries were last seen going to the mines
1. There's a bounty placed by Haskar to find a 'demon dog'
1. There is a bounty placed by the farmes to slay two wyverns
