# Pennies and Dimes


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
In the search for the missing dwarven mercenaries, the adventurers venture into the mountains surrounding the mining city of Dead Snow. They search for a group of miners who have last bought carpentry supplies. The mercenaries sought these miners to buy these supplies and presumably, they were not seeing again.

## Trouble in the Mines



The party travels to the mines to the south of the city of Dead Snow. It's one day of travel without many perils. When they reach the mines, they notice the miners in turmoil. They are fleeing the main mine and shouting for help.

Without thinking twice, the adventurers rush to the mine entrance. There, inside the mine they see a huge fungus with four sharp tendrils dragging and devouring miners. They rush in their assistance. However, the fungus regurgitates small mushroom-like creatures that attack the front-line members of the party. Meanwhile, <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Myconids</span> appear from side corridors. The adventurers are now trapped with a large fungus beast in front of them and Myconids are appearing from many corridors.


It's a though combat. The fighters split and hold the line while archers shoot arrows and wizards and clerics cast their spells. While this is a challenging combat and the party suffers many injuries, they are successful and defeat the creatures. They venture in the mines looking for any survivors.

## 120 feet below


Eldrin uses his familiar to scout the mine. He notices another fungus plant up ahead, but the creature burrows itself under the ground. There is a small bridge with rails separating the party from the place where the beast dug underground. The party proceeds with caution.




When they reach the bridge and the chasm, more Myconids climb through the chasm walls and ambush them. The fungus also breaks one of the mine walls and attacks whoever comes near it. It's vines try to grapple the fighters and <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Mutombo</span> is grappled by the beast. The creature tries to throw him in the chasm below, but thankfully, he holds his feet and keeps fighting it.

Trying to free his friend, <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Sigmund</span> jumps through the chasm and positions himself such that he can cast a thunderwave to push the creature into de deepest down below. Unfortunately, Sigmund does not plan his actions in the best possible way, and Mutombo is also caught in the spell area of effect. Both fall in the chasm and this is the end of Mutombo.

After clearing the mine. They interrogate some of the surviving miners and discover that a gang of ruffians lead by <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Lennin</span> charges the miners for "protection". They know that some mercenaries passed through the region a few days ago to parley supplies with them, but they don't know their hideout.



Investigating the mine, Eldrin and his familiar notice a false wall where mud and bricks were placed to cover a passage. They break through it and delve into the tunnel that soon opens into a small valley hidden under the mountains. They will quickly discover the fate of the mercenaries.

# Lennin and his Gang


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
  Lennin, a ruthless ruffian who terrorizes the city miners. His love for whores is only matched by his greed for gold. He has gathered a couple of underlings under his banner and charges miners for his protection. The lady of shadows has little interest in his greed as long as he play his role as a pawn in the chess board.
</span>





## Storming the front gate


Eldrin uses his familiar once again to observe the vicinity. He finds out that Lennin's gang has a small camp surrounded by the protection of the mountains. The ruffians are caught quite off-guard as they are calmly eating and loading a cart.

The party starts to plan an attack but their discussion takes long enough for the ruffians to finish their meal and start to move back to their wathcin posts. Tired of all the planning, <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Bren</span> and <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Sigmund</span> start to climb the rocky wall to better position themselves and attack the enemies.

Meanwhile, <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Svart, Eldrin</span> and <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Ulfgar</span> storm the front gate.
One of the bandits who was loading the chart uses the chart as aa barricade while the others start to pin down the attackers. Seeing that they were easy targets for the enemy archers, <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Eldrin</span> cast a fog spell, which prevent the archers from easily firing at them.
Svart goes into a rampage and Ulgar also attacks the bandits. Bren and Sigmund are not at the top of the rock cliff and they attack the enemy archers. Amid all the chaos, Lennin appears from one of the tents carrying his spiked club and loudly shouting that the club was thirsty.


It's a savage combat, Eldrin cast a thunderwave to throw the loosely secured cargo over the bandits and Ulfgar engages Lennin. Almost all the bandits are defeated, but Lennin takes Ulfgar down and Svart is on the verge of falling. 

Thankfully, <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Bren's</span> arrows are enough to take the treacherous bandit down. The party rests, savage the small hoard of gold and coins that the bandits had and prepare to get back to town. However, <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Eldrin</span> notices a small letter in Lennin's belongings. He investigates it and reads:



<div class='descriptive'>


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Kill as many as you want. Take as much as you want. Drop the bodies at the temple under the mountain.</span>
<div style="text-align: right;">

</div>

As <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Ulfgar</span> finds a dwarven key that Ragrin had gave to the dwarven mercernaries that the party was looking for. They connect the dots and assume that the mercenary band was defeated and their bodies where delivered to this place. The set for the night and make plans for hiking the mountain and tracking the missing mercenaries.

**DM notes:**

The design of the encounters in the mines take two things into consideration. In the first, the sense of urgency prevents the party from entering the mine with caution. This is nice because I can flank and split the party members and they have to deal with enemies coming from multiple directions.

In the latter, the creature trying to grapple the PCs was something that I thought on the fly. Moving it to the chasm and trying to throw people down below just came as a natural follow-up. If I'm grabbing something and this something is slashing and cutting me, let me throw it, hope it dies, and I can safely eat it. Anyway, throwing people in the chasm placed a real danger to the combat. 1st passing strength saves to escape the grapple and 2nd passing a dexterity save to hold in a ledge and avoid the fall. Everything was going nice until Sigmund decided to cast the thunderwave. Once he did so, I asked what is its area? And they were like: oh-oh. As the chasm is a 3D thing, they started to argue that it could be cast in a way that could save Mutombo, but I refuted that we are playing in a 2D plane (Roll20) and we should stick with this. One of the PCs also argued: hey he knows his spells and he wouldn't have cast it if it would target a friend. I refused once again: you are a 2nd level PC. You never faced such danger, and you never had to do though calls in a short 6 second frame. Once you describe your action, you have to deal with the consequences. The PC who controlled Mutombo was actually glad about the decision and he mentioned that he would not have enjoyed if I have spared his life.   <span style="color: red;">Here lies my first PC kill.</span>
