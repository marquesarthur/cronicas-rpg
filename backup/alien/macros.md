&{template:alien}{{character-name=@{selected|character_name} }}{{roll-name= 1 Sensor Operator}}{{ FIRE WEAPON: You can only attack an enemy which you have Target Locked. Roll for RANGED COMBAT, modified by the Bonus rating of the weapon you use and the range to the target (see the table below). If your attack hits, you inflict damage equal to the weapon’s Damage rating on the target, just like in personal combat. For every extra SUCCESS you roll, you inflict one additional point of damage. Read more about damage to ships on page 197. If the pilot of the target ship Evades (see above), each they roll eliminates one rolled by you}} {{LAUNCH COUNTERMEASURES: This reactive action is used to launch defensive measures such as sensor decoys and sensor drones (see page 176). If any offensive weapons are fired at your ship in this Turn from SHORT range (adjacent zone) or more, your gunner rolls RANGED COMBAT, modified by the Bonus rating of the countermeasure. Every rolled by your gunner eliminates one rolled by the attacker. If you are attacked multiple times, make a separate roll for each incoming attack}}



&{template:alien}{{character-name=@{selected|character_name} }}{{roll-name= 4 Engineer Actions}}{{EMERGENCY REPAIRS: A minor or major component damage (see next page) is hastily repaired. Roll for HEAVY MACHINERY or COMTECH (or both) as indicated by the table on pages 198–199. The repair is just a quick fix—it requires no spare parts, but it will only hold for one Shift. For permanent repairs, see page 200.}} {{REACTOR OVERLOAD: Requires a HEAVY MACHINERY roll. If successful, the reactor will overload and explode at the end of the following Turn, destroying the ship and killing everyone on board. Make sure to get into those EEVs fast. The self-destruct sequence can be stopped with another HEAVY MACHINERY roll (takes one Turn).}}
