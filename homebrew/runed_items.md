# Runed Items

The weapon was gifted to Ohin Steadfast, a wild elf ranger, who tracked the corrupted arch druid in the thunder peaks where the two battled to death. Legend says that Ohin stroke the blade in the Peaks and from time to time its lightning is absorbed by the blade, making it even stronger.

'Little bacon' was a thief that was famous for his thievery deeds in the Dalelands. He was a member of a thief guild dismantled a long time ago.
