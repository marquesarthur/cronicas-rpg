## Shield of Shadows

<i class="ra ra-hood ra-2x"></i> Damning an enemy to the darkness of their own evil, this curse surrounds the afflicted in a sphere of perfect darkness and silence, blinding them.

When you choose this school at **2nd level**, you learn how to manipulate the shadow weave. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you or you are the target of a single target spell, you can use your reaction to blind the target. The creature's attack rolls against you 
have disadvantage or, in the case of a spell, the caster does not have line of sight against you potentially having to choose a new target.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


## Weaver of Shadows

<i class="ra ra-bleeding-eye"></i> You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. You are immune to an enemy's shield of shadows class Feature.

## Shadow Magic

Shadow adepts hurl themselves into the abyss of the Shadow Weave, immediately acquiring all the gifts available to casual students and discovering secrets unavailable to all but the most dedicated.

At **6th level**, once per turn, you can apply one of the following shadow weave metamagics:



<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-close"></span> **Deceptive Spell (Adrammelech)** When you Cast a Spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its Effects, one target of the spell has disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span> **Blistering Spell (Belias)** You can use the Shadow Weave to make your spells harder for Weave users to dispel. A spell cast through the shadow weave cannot be countered or dispelled by a spell of the same level or lower. Spellcasting checks have disadvantage.

<i class="ra ra-skull"></i> **Blightful Spell (Zalhera)** When you cast a spell that deals acid, fire, thunder, cold, or lightning damage, you can change the damage type to necrotic. Additionally, undead creatures cannot benefit from resistances to the spell necrotic damage.


 


You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

## Shadow Double

<i class="ra ra-double-team"></i> Starting at **10th level**,  a shadow adept can create an identical clone of himself using shadows.


As a bonus action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute. The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The shadow has AC 13 + your proficiency modifier and any spells or attacks that target a creature can target the illusion. 

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.
Any items or powers that modify your movement apply to your double, e.g., if you wear slippers of spider climbing the clone can walk through walls as if it was also wearing the item. You can also spend 15 feet of movement to switch places with your shadow double.


For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. 
Additionally, a creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell DC otherwise it cannot distinguish between you and you shadow. If a creature fails this saving throw, as a rules of thumb, creatures with Intelligence lower than 7 will attack whoever (you or the shadow) is closer to them. Creatures with a score higher than that may lose one attack to discover who is the illusion and proceed to attack the shadow adept, if the adept is still in range. 


You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
