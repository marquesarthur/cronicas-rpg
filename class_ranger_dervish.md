abstract: Nearly all dervishes belong to nomadic cultures. These nomads are not simple wanderers with no roots to call their own - they have their ancient traditions, and their societies simply do not consider permanent settlements an important part of their nature. Wild, exotic, and as dangerous as her whirling blades, the dervish epitomizes speed, quickness, and abandon.

## Dervish Magic
Starting at **3rd level**, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Dervish Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

| Spell level | Expanded Spells  |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | Comprehend Languages (Ritual) |
| 5th | Misty Step |
| 9th | Thunder Step |
| 13th | Dimension Door  |
| 17th | Far Step |

## Whirling Blades
At **3rd level**, you master the art of two-weapon fighting. 

When you make your first Attack on Your Turn, you can decide to Attack recklessly. Doing so gives you an extra 
1d6 weapon damage per weapon attack, but you must use your bonus action to attack with your off-hand weapon.

___

## Nomad 

The dervish nomadic culture allows them to adapt to the most inhospitable environments. For example, a dervish traveling through a marsh or a rain forest will quickly learn about edible and poisonous mushrooms, therefore gaining resistance to poison damage.


At **3rd level**, if you spend 2 or more days traveling through a landscape, you gain resistance to either poison, cold or fire damage. Whenever you finish a long rest, you may change your damage resistance type.

___


## Extra Attack
Beginning at **5th level**, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


___

## Mirage
By **7th level**, you may cast the Mirror Image spell as a bonus action, without expending a spell slot or the need of any spell components. 

You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

___

## A Thousand Cuts
At **11th level**, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.

___

## Deadly Perimeter

Starting at **15th level**, you have honed your ability to fight with two weapons both aggressively and defensively. As a reaction to the first attack roll a creature makes against you, you start to use your blades to deflect any incoming attacks made by that creature against you.

Make a contested attack roll against all the creature's attack rolls on that turn. If you win, the creature's attack misses you and you may roll damage for your attack roll.
The damage roll alternates between your main-hand weapon and your off-hand weapon. For example, if you deflect three attacks using this feature, the first damage roll is from your main-hand weapon, the second from your off-hand weapon and the last, from your main-hand again.


You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
