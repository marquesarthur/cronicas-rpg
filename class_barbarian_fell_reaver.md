abstract: The fell reaver is the curse laid upon those who drink the blood of a fiend. The demonic essence corrupts whoever drinks it, granting them unholy strength. The demonic blood runs through many barbaric clans that made pacts with hellish entities in ancient times. Some barbarians have learned to tap the fiendish power to fuel their rage even against fiends themselves.

## Fiendish Heritage


<i class="ra ra-horns"></i>  At **3rd level**, when you adopt this path, you bask into the power of a fiend, a demon, or a yugoloth. Either you or your ancestors had contacted one of these entities in a crossroad and the magic blood from the hellish pact awaken in your veins. At your option, you gain minor physical attributes that reflect your hellish pact, as an example, your eye pupils turn red, you gain small horn protuberances, or your blood turns green.  You can speak the abyssal and infernal languages. 

___

## Fell Rage


While raging, you have resistance to fire and poison damage. Additionally, your rage gains one of the following benefits depending on your fell heritage:



<i class="ra ra-lightning-sword"></i> **Gothmog (Balor)** Similar to a Balrog's sword, flames, smog and crackling lighting surrounds your weapon. Weapon attacks from one weapon that you hold score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. 

<i class="ra ra-dripping-blade"></i> **Mannoroth (Pit fiend)**  Similar to a Pit fiend's poisonous bite, sulphur and poison drip from your blade. Weapon attacks from one weapon that you hold debilitate your enemies. The first attack roll of a creature hit by your weapon has disadvantage. 

<i class="ra ra-kaleidoscope"></i> **Aulmpiter (Ultroloth)** Even ragining, you are capable of drawing the inherent arcane energy of a yugoloth to imbue your weapon with raw magic. Weapon attacks from one weapon that you hold deal an additional 1d6 force magic damage. The damage dice increases to a d8 at 7th level and to a d10 at 11th level.

___

## Demonic Blood

<i class="ra ra-player-pyromaniac"></i> At **6th level**, you further awaken the fiendish power from your demonic heritage. Similar to how demons resist magic, you can momentarily gain resistance to spell effects. If you fail a saving throw from any spell or other magical effects while raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.



## Fell Patron

At **10th level**, your deeds and actions caught the attention of a fiend entity. Either directly or indirectly, an entity from an appropriate hellish plane further enhances your fell rage. Once per rage, you can use your bonus action to inflict your enemies with a hellish effect granted by your fell patron. The save DC equal for your hellish effect is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.



<i class="ra ra-burning-embers "></i> **Cinder (Balor)** Similar to a Balor's fiery aura, you burst in hellish flame. Choose up to five creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried. Your fiery aura ignores resistance. 

<i class="ra ra-broken-skull"></i> **Haliax (Pit fiend)**  Similar to a Pit fiend's fear aura, your mere presence strikes fear in the heart of your enemies. Choose up to five creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

<i class="ra ra-doubled"></i> **Caeth (Ultroloth)** You bask into the raw magic used by the Yugoloth while you momentarily manifest a Ultroloth's gaze. You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Upon arrival, an adjacent creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be restrained until the end of your next turn.
