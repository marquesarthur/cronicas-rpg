## Prerequisite


You cannot wield a shield or have a shield as your holy symbol. A sword saint often has his holy symbol tied to the pummel of his sword or wrapped around his hand.

___


## Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at **3rd level**, you gain the following Channel Divinity option.


**Hallow Weapon.** As a bonus action, you can imbue one sword that you are holding with positive/negative energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, when you score a critical hit with the weapon or use your Divine Smite feature, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.




 ___



## Blade Barrier

Starting at **7th level**, you can use your reaction provided that a creature moves within 10 feet of you.
You move 5 feet before the attack and then, you make a melee opportunity attack against it. If you hit the creature, its speed drops to 0 for the rest of the turn. This stops any movement they may have been taking.

___


## Relentless Blade

Beginning at **15th level**, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests. In addition to any other benefits your channel divinity provides, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a sword takes extra damage equal to half your Paladin level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.

### Sword Saint Spells

Sword Saint Spells are one of the most well kept secrets of the order. You cannot acquire these spells through the lore bard magical secret class feature. College of valor or sword bards can still learn these spells.  


Starting at **3rd level**, you have learned to regain some of your magical energy by meditating on your sword-play. Once per day when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended Spell Slots to recover. The Spell Slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Paladin level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 3rd level or higher.


#### Hellcry Punch
*1st-level evocation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 Reaction which you take when you are hit by an attack
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round


As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails.

On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and a wave of thunderous force sweeps out from your strike. The target must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 1d6 thunder damage and, on a failed save, is pushed 10 feet away from you.





___

#### Lightning Stab
*2nd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon), S
- **Duration:** 1 round


As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails.



On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and purple lightning leaps from the target to 3 different creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of it. The second creatures take 2d6 lightning damage. You can teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to any of the creatures targeted by the lightning.

___


#### Icewolf Bite
*2nd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon), S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute


As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails.


On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and spectral frost covers the target's weapon or gear causing the target to take 2d6 ice damage. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is restrained and takes 2d6 ice damage. On a successful save, the spells ends.

___


#### Stasis Sword
*3rd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon), S
- **Duration:** up to 1 minute


As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails.


On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and a rift through time and space deals an extra 3d6 force damage to the target, which is them slowed. The target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity Saving Throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a Bonus Action, not both. Regardless of the creature's Abilities or Magic Items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged Attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to Cast a Spell with a Casting Time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.

A creature affected by this spell makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends.
