## Prerequisite


You cannot wield a shield or have a shield as your holy symbol. A sword saint often has his holy symbol tied to the pummel of his sword or wrapped around his hand.

___


## Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at **3rd level**, you gain the following Channel Divinity option.


**Hallow Weapon.** As a bonus action, you can imbue one sword that you are holding with positive/negative energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a sword takes extra damage equal to half your Paladin level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.




 ___



## Blade Barrier

Starting at **7th level**, you can use your reaction provided that a creature moves within 10 feet of you.
You move 5 feet before the attack and then, you make a melee opportunity attack against it. If you hit the creature, its speed drops to 0 for the rest of the turn. This stops any movement they may have been taking.

___


## Relentless Blade

Beginning at **15th level**, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests. In addition to any other benefits your channel divinity provides, when you score a critical hit with the weapon or use your Divine Smite feature, you can make one extra melee weapon attack as a bonus action. This feature synergizes with your sword saint spells, e.g., if you cast Judgment Blade and spend one divine smite as part of the attack, you can make one extra attack as a bonus action.

Starting at **3rd level**, you have learned to regain some of your magical energy by meditating on your sword-play. Once per day when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended Spell Slots to recover. The Spell Slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Paladin level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 3rd level or higher.
