# Pennies and Dimes


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
In the search for the missing dwarven mercenaries, the adventurers venture into the mountains surrounding the mining city of Dead Snow. They search for a group of miners who have last bought carpentry supplies. The mercenaries sought these miners to buy these supplies and presumably, they were not seeing again.

## Trouble in the Mines



The party travels to the mines to the south of the city of Dead Snow. It's one day of travel without many perils. When they reach the mines, they notice the miners in turmoil. They are fleeing the main mine and shouting for help.

Without thinking twice, the adventurers rush to the mine entrance. There, inside the mine they see a huge fungus with four sharp tendrils dragging and devouring miners. They rush in their assistance. However, the fungus regurgitates small mushroom-like creatures that attack the front-line members of the party. Meanwhile, <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Myconids</span> appear from side corridors. The adventurers are now trapped with a large fungus beast in front of them and Myconids are appearing from many corridors.


It's a though combat. The fighters split and hold the line while archers shoot arrows and wizards and clerics cast their spells. While this is a challenging combat and the party suffers many injuries, they are successful and defeat the creatures. They venture in the mines looking for any survivors.


## 120 feet below


Eldrin uses his familiar to scout the mine. He notices another fungus plant up ahead, but the creature burrows itself under the ground. There is a small bridge with rails separating the party from the place where the beast dug underground. The party proceeds with caution.

When they reach the bridge and the chasm, more Myconids climb through the chasm walls and ambush them. The fungus also breaks one of the mine walls and attacks whoever comes near it. It's vines try to grapple the fighters and <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Mutombo</span> is grappled by the beast. The creature tries to throw him in the chasm below, but thankfully, he holds his feet and keeps fighting it.

Trying to free his friend, <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Sigmund</span> jumps through the chasm and positions himself such that he can cast a thunderwave to push the creature into de deepest down below. Unfortunately, Sigmund does not plan his actions in the best possible way, and Mutombo is also caught in the spell area of effect. Both fall in the chasm and this is the end of Mutombo.

After clearing the mine. They interrogate some of the surviving miners and discover that a gang of ruffians lead by <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Lennin</span> charges the miners for "protection". They know that some mercenaries passed through the region a few days ago to parley supplies with them, but they don't know their hideout.



Investigating the mine, Eldrin and his familiar notice a false wall where mud and bricks were placed to cover a passage. They break through it and delve into the tunnel that soon opens into a small valley hidden under the mountains. They will quickly discover the fate of the mercenaries.

DM notes:

The design of these encounters takes two things into consideration. In the former, the sense of urgency prevents the party from entering the mine with caution. This is nice because I can flank and split the party members and they have to deal with enemies coming from multiple directions.

In the latter, the creature trying to grapple the PCs was something that I thought on the fly. Moving it to the chasm and trying to throw people down below just came as a natural follow-up. If I'm grabbing something and this something is slashing and cutting me, let me throw it, hope it dies, and I can safely eat it. Anyway, throwing people in the chasm placed a real danger to the combat. 1st passing strength saves to escape the grapple and 2nd passing a dexterity save to hold in a ledge and avoid the fall. Everything was going nice until Sigmund decided to cast the thunderwave. Once he did so, I asked what is its area? And they were like: oh-oh. As the chasm is a 3D thing, they started to argue that it could be cast in a way that could save Mutombo, but I refuted that we are playing in a 2D plane (Roll20) and we should stick with this. One of the PCs also argued: hey he knows his spells and he wouldn't have cast it if it would target a friend. I refused once again: you are a 2nd level PC. You never faced such danger, and you never had to do though calls in a short 6 second frame. Once you describe your action, you have to deal with the consequences. The PC who controlled Mutombo was actually glad about the decision and he mentioned that he would not have enjoyed it if I have spared his life.   <span style="color: red;">Here lies my first PC kill.</span>

# Lennin and his Gang


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
  Dead snow, the youngest city to join the Silver Marshes city confederate.
  It's known for its mines where precious gems and ore are found. More recently, 
  miners found a large gold veil and ever since, the city faces the troubles and challenges of a gold rush. Its inns are full, and a tent city is growing outside the city walls.  
</span>





## Road to dead snow


The adventurers band together and guide the caravan through the road that leads to Dead Snow. The path can barely be called a road and the rain season turned the road in a steep and slippery path.

Passing through the ruins of a long abandoned entry-post, the adventurers notice a band of goblins riding worgs approaching the caravan. They make a stand and fight the riders. It's a quick combat and the tide is in their favour. 
Soon after, they are cleaning their swords and scavaging any spoils.
Using Edwige as a scout, Eldrin notices a larger group of raiders moving to the mountains to the east. However, the group decides to investigate them only after they finish their business in the city.



During the 3 days of travel to reach the city, the party engages in small errands. 
Sigmund talks with the caravan cooker <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Poppy Warmwater</span> and discover that he is highly suspicious of any pranks by a certain prankster, though he does not who he or she is. Sigmund says that he may be able to help Poppy. Eldrin talks with a bard that travels with the caravan <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Colt Le fleur</span> and asks for any rumors or stories in the region. While Colt is not aware of any rumours other than the gold rush, Eldrin discovers that Colt has a talking cat and he wants to know more about the cat later.
Bren spies Ragrin and discovers that one of the caravan wagons contains a large and well-crafted coffin. Finally, the tailor of the caravan <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Eleanor shy smile</span> approaches Svart. Without much explanation, she asks him to deliver a letter for the head of the city, lady <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Alertha Icespear.</span> Svart accepts the errand.


In the last day before reaching the city, the caravan is ambushed once again. This time, goblins mounted in black bears. The party fights them but soon discover that one of the goblins is a spell caster. This tiny greenish thing tries to dominate Svarts mind and turn him against the rest of the party. Svart resists the spell and when cornered, the small goblin simple vanishes. Eldrin studies the last spell cast by the golbin spell caster and discovers that it is from the school of conjuration, supposing that the goblin teleported to a safer location.

Without any more threats, the caravan passes the tent city around the walls of dead snow and reaches the city gates. 


<div class='descriptive'>
Dead snow is a set of loosely coupled quests originally found in 
the Forgotten Realms supplement "Silver Marches".
I've made a set of changes grabbing things from the "Lost Mine of Phandelver" 
and also introducing my own NPCs as the caravan members. 
</div>



  
## City Gates


Reaching the city gates, the adventurers ask for passage. The guard is afraid of letting so many wagons and strangers getting in the city and he goes after his captain. Meanwhile, Ragrin tries to convince another guard to provide them shelter. Soon they enter in a discussion and Ragrin gets pissed. The rude dwarf lowers his pants and pisses in the city gates yelling that the caravan doesn't need the city protection.



<br>

With all the gathered information, the adventurers travel to the mines up in the south searching for the missing mercenaries.

<div class='descriptive'>
Reminders:
1. The missing mercenaries were last seen going to the mines
1. There's a bounty placed by Haskar to find a 'demon dog'
1. There is a bounty placed by the farmes to slay two wyverns
