abstract: But what do we have left, once we abandon the lie? Chaos? A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all! Chaos isnâ€™t a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some, are given a chance to climb. They refuse, they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.

## Veil Warding


When you choose this school at **2nd level**, you learn how to manipulate the sevenfold veil to create powerful wards. As a reaction, you can use one of the following veils depending on your level:

1. **Red**. Triggered when you take fire damage. You gain resistance to the target damage.
2. **Green**. Triggered when you take poison damage. You gain resistance to the target damage.
3. **Blue**. Triggered when you take cold damage. You gain resistance to the target damage.
4. **Orange**. Triggered when you take acid damage. You gain resistance to the target damage.
5. **Yellow**. Triggered when you take lightning damage. You gain resistance to the target damage.
6. **Indigo**. Triggered when you are subject to an effect that imposes the restrained condition or when you try to escape a grapple. You roll width advantage.
7. **Violet**. Triggered when you are subject to an effect that imposes the  blinded condition. You roll the save width advantage.

As an example, a 4th level initiate has access to the red, green, blue, and orange veils. At 7th level, you master all the veils.


You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Unanswerable Strike

At **6th level**, an initiate can raise two veils at once. Any time you use your warding, choose an ally within 30 feet of you. The ally gain the benefits of your choosen ward. Additionally, until the end of your next turn, the first time both you or your ally cast a cantrip or make a weapon attack roll, you choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder and the target takes 1d10 extra damage of the type you chose.

## Kaleidoscopic Doom

Starting at **10th level**, an Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil learns the secret of the awesome kaleidoscopic doom. She designates one creature within 60 feet and turns prismatic effects against the creature. Roll a d8 to determine which color affects the creature. Whenever you roll a 8, you choose two different colors. Use your wizard spell save DC for any effects that require a saving throw.

Design note: the initial damage of the Kaleidoscopic Doom is balanced around the firebolt cantrip.
