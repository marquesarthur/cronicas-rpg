abstract: She enjoys music, often personally enticing men with the sound of her singing. She is infamous in legend for seducing human men with her beauty, inevitably to either kill them through sexual exhaustion or to drive them insane. However, she does seem to have genuine feelings of loneliness and desire for company, and when she comes across a lover who can provide her with entertainment beyond that of the flesh, she is shown to be especially delighted. -- description of Felurian from Wise Man's fear

## Fey Court

You have been touched by the fey. At your option, you gain minor physical attributes that reflect your fey ancestry, as an example, one of your eye pupils turn grene, you gain small horn protuberances, flowers grow on your shoulders, etc.


You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Additionally, once per short rest as a reaction to being hit by an attack, you can teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see, causing the triggering attack to miss. 


## Fey Magic


Your link to the feywild allows you to learn spells not normally associated with the sorcerer class. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Fey Soul Spells table.

| Class level | Expanded Spells  |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | Faerie Fire |
| 3rd | Misty Step |
| 5th | Hypnotic Pattern |
| 9th | One new spell of 4th or lower |
| 12nd | One new spell of 5th or lower  |
| 14th | One new spell of 6th or lower  |

This class feature puts the sorcerer at 21 spells.  When compared to full casters as a Wizard with 44 or a Bard with 19, it seems that the Sorcerer got the short end of the stick.

## Moon Glade Favor

Starting at **6th level**, your connection with the Feywild deepens. When you use sorcery points, your fey bloodline makes you draw magic directly from the Feywild, causing you to look more gracious and formidable to your opponents. 

Whenever you use your Metamagic class feature to augment a spell or when you spend sorcery points to gain spell slots, you gain temporary hit points equal to three times the number of sorcery points used to create a spell slot or to augment a spell with metamagic. As an example, applying the Heightened Spell metamagic would grant you 9 temporary hit points while creating a spell slot of 3rd level would grant 15 hit points.

## Faerie Wings

At **14th level**, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragonfly wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.

You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

## Arch Fey Metamagic

Starting at **18th level**, the raw magic from the fey court deeply enhances your spell casting abilities. When using Fey metamagic, you look wildly unpredictable and your appearance changes similar to the change of seasons. The sharp wind of Winter whirlwinds around you, your surroundings boils as the harsh Summer weather, etc.

Whenever you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can spend 3 sorcery points to maintain concentration on up to two spells. One of these spells cannot have been modified by metamagic and the spell duration is halved, e.g., a 1 minute spell would last for 5 turns. While you maintain concentration on two spells, you have resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing From Nonmagical Attacks.
