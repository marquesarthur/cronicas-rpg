abstract: Colors are imbued with their own magical properties. Just as exotic substances and mystic words have the power to repel certain creatures, colors also harbor innate properties that can be brought forth by the skilled mage, culminating in the perfection of the prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. Few spells match the beauty and power of these potent abjurations. They are perfect defenses, representing a union of magical lore and keen insight into the workings of nature. A master of defensive magic, the Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil approaches the prismatic barrier by mastering one by one its constituent veils or layers.

## Veil Warding


When you choose this school at **2nd level**, you learn how to manipulate the sevenfold veil to create powerful wards. As a reaction, you can use one of the following veils depending on your level:

1. **Red**. Triggered when you take fire damage. You gain resistance to the target damage.
2. **Green**. Triggered when you take poison damage. You gain resistance to the target damage.
3. **Blue**. Triggered when you take cold damage. You gain resistance to the target damage.
4. **Orange**. Triggered when you take acid damage. You gain resistance to the target damage.
5. **Yellow**. Triggered when you take lightning damage. You gain resistance to the target damage.
6. **Indigo**. Triggered when you are subject to an effect that imposes the restrained condition or when you try to escape a grapple. You roll width advantage.
7. **Violet**. Triggered when you are subject to an effect that imposes the  blinded condition. You roll the save width advantage.

As an example, a 4th level initiate has access to the red, green, blue, and orange veils. At 7th level, you master all the veils.


You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Unanswerable Strike

At **6th level**, an initiate can raise two veils at once. Any time you use your warding, choose an ally within 30 feet of you. The ally gain the benefits of your choosen ward. Additionally, until the end of your next turn, the first time both you or your ally cast a cantrip or make a weapon attack roll, you choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder and the target takes 1d10 extra damage of the type you chose.

## Kaleidoscopic Doom

Starting at **10th level**, an Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil learns the secret of the awesome kaleidoscopic doom. She designates one creature within 60 feet and turns prismatic effects against the creature. Roll a d8 to determine which color affects the creature. Whenever you roll a 8, you choose two different colors. Use your wizard spell save DC for any effects that require a saving throw.

Design note: the initial damage of the Kaleidoscopic Doom is balanced around the firebolt cantrip.
