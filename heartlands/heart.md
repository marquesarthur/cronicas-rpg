# Shadowdale


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
There is a huge shadow over the dalelands. The corruption taints the lands. A curse that the <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Iron Brothers</span> seek to break. We travelled through dungeons deep and caverns old. Faced the perils and lies of the drow houses and pierced the heart of an old god. It matters not ... I am still alive.

Assault on Underdark
</span>
<br><br>


The iron brothers were still licking their wounds. They got their asses kicked while trying to assault underdark and make their way to find the location of the heart of Moander. The mercenary band almost knocked on death's door before diving into a waterfall and making their escape. Here they were back at the base camp. Poor bastards, getting ready to attack the underdark fortress yet again. At least this time there was a difference, I was in the raiding party. 


<div class='descriptive'>
Before I continue the story, let me tell you a few things about my myself. 

<span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">(1)</span> I get shit done. Any mercernary band that has the bad omen of having me among their ranks has survived to tell the story. 

<span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">(2)</span> I am a compulsive gambler. I like to gamble on stupid and unpredictable things (at least for me). It suffices to say that I own a lot of people a lot of money.

<span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">(3)</span> I am cursed.

The factions in the realms hired a group of adventurers to investigate the <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Stone Tooth</span> near the city of <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Blasingdell</span>. Rumour tells that the mountain is the entrance to the Forge of Fury and all sorts of magic and gold lie beneath the old mountain.

<br>

There I was, sleeping yet another day while some of my companions made their wach. At least this time I was not among complete strangers. The familiar faces of <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Raetrhiel</span> -- an elf arcane trickster -- and <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Larch</span> -- a cleric of Lathander --  eased my rest. I had faced perils with them before and I trusted their clever minds and sharp tongues, qualities far beyond the ones from a barbarian.
I also remember a <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Sorcerer</span> and a <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Druid</span> among us albeit their names escape my mind.

Soon our rest was interrupted, enemies lurked in the distance and the rogue shouted that we had company. The group quickly got ready for the fight. The creatures that emerged from the shadows were tiny Kobolds -- small reptilian humanoids with black scaled skin and white horns. A winged kobold seemed to lead the raid group and apparently, they thought that we were easy targets.

<br>

Poor tiny things, they did not know that death was at their door. We fought bravely, arrows flew through the field and spells were thrown at our assailants. I succumbed to my rage and whipped the creatures. As fast as the battle had started, it also had ended. 

<br>

Searching their bodies, we found a map indicating some entrance to the Stone Tooth. Lucky us! We gathered our belongings and marched to the place

In the base of the rocky mountain, we found a tunnel carved in the rock. We entered the place and soon discovered  what kobolds are known for. These tiny little bastards use guerrilla tactics and sheer weight of numbers to defeat enemies. They preferred to lay traps or ambushes, and would only engage a foe directly after it was weakened<sup>1</sup>.

<br>

While we were successful in finding some of the traps in the entrance, we were not as lucky as we proceeded through their carved tunnels. Not only we had to deal with their traps but also  <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Giant Weasels</span> and some sort of Kobold tinkerer who threw  <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Centipedes</span> and alchemical fire on us. As we fought our way through waves and more waves of traps and scaled bastards, they kept shouting, mocking us, and asking for the blessing of their leader  <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Night Scale</span>.

As we reached the end of the caves, we found a small and ornament room protected by leathery tapestry. We stormed the room and there he was, Night Scale - a winged Kobold sorcerer. He mocked us and said that we would have the same fate as the adventurers the came before us. He could not be more wrong.

<br>

I unleashed all my rage and my hellhounds fought beside me. My companions threw spells and arrows at the kobold and his minions. I did not imagine that the kobold sorcerer could cast a fireball at us or that he could haste his underlings. Nonetheless, that was his doom. One of our attacks broke his concentration and the hasted kobolds were now in a torpor as the spell effect ran off. We turned the battle in our favour and most of the kobolds fell. The winged one tried to flee through a hole in the ceiling but I stopped him with my whip. As he begged for mercy, the party gave the final blow.

<br>

In his last breath, the damn thing whispered <span style="color: red; font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">Oh night scale, forgive your humble servant. Adventurers are coming. Please avenge me!</span>


<br>

Well. It seems like the cave is bigger than we thought. We will have more perils before we face Night Scale, but our battle against him my friends is a tale for another day.
