Dear lizardfolk tribe's leader,


I'm coach Bern, teacher at some random community school and retired olympic medalist. You might not know me, and I deeply apologize because I may say something inappropriate for lizardfolks culture, but rest assured that I speak with years of competence, having taught multiple kids and being the most successful coach in the history of volleyball, accumulating more than 30 major titles in a twenty-year career [at least that's what my wikipedia says]. But enough about my credentials, I want to keep the letter short, so let's cut to the chase. 


I met the young Karthak  at a trip in the lands of Barovia. I was seeking potential new talents for several sports and despite his peculiarity for human flesh or speaking about himself in third person, Karthak caught my eye. The lass is a remarkable athlete, he can hold his breath for so long that even Michael Phelps would envy him... and I'm not even talking about his jaw line and charismatic demeanor, which can be quite the asset for your tribe's PR. 


The boy keeps talking about some corruption, but I honestly do not understand it. I can only imagine that this has to do with the bright heart of the young minds and their eager to fight corrupt institutions. I can see him as a leader for new generations and that his outstanding qualities will drive the tribe to new standards.


When Karthak asked for a letter of recommendation, I have to say that I wrote it with a heavy heart because that could mean his departure. Nonetheless, I wish only the better for the boy.


Sincerely,
