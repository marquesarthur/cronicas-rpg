<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Kelvin's Cairn</span></span>,
a 1,000 foot-tall mountain was the only peak within 
a thousand miles in the far north of ice wind dale.
Treacherous, mortal, and I just find a terrible place to die.... 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;"> no one would ever find my body there</span></span>, but anyway

After our adventures in Car-Dineval, we head up north to 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Caer-Konig</span></span> -- 
famous for its knucklehead trouts
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">which is basically our diet ever since we got to the region of the ten towns</span></span>
.
The townsfolk was welcoming to our "kind", so called adventurers.
In fact, speaker 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Trovus</span></span>
spoke with us about a series of unfortunate events:

* A magic lantern stolen from a local shop
* Goats stolen from the <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Hook line and sinker</span></span> tavern barn
* A small sack of pearls stolen from the 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">frozen far expeditions</span></span> shop



The thefts worried the townsfolk and it was up to us, adventurers to locate the missing items. 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">My bets were on the local pawn-shop</span></span>, but unfortunately,
it was not that easy. Our investigations directed us to a track leading to the 
treacherous <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Kelvin's Cairn</span></span> mountain.


On the mountain foot we found an old dwarf fortress. It was an advanced outpost, yet 
it could hold a small garrison of dwarves, or any sort of creature. 
We proceeded with caution, praying that a crossbow would not pop out of the many 
arrowslits in direct line of sight. <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span></span> was marveled by the building 
and with some effort, we got to its front gate without any interruptions. 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">I wondered how such fort was abandoned</span></span>.


Inside the building, we found several cages, and the stolen goats. 
An inert zombie ogre rested inside another cage and before 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Or'o</span></span>, the druid, could 
speak with the animals and know more about how they got here, the gate behind us 
shut close. The ogre's cage opened and it violently rushed towards us. 


We readied ourselves for battle, soon there could be many more enemies storming from 
corridors leading to the hallway. <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Ranmorr</span></span> and 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span></span> held the line while 
our spellcaster, <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Fate</span></span>, magically enhanced our accuracy.
Indeed there were more enemies and they appeared out of the thin air.
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Duergars</span></span>, or gray dwarfs, 
who used some sort of spell to enlarge themselves. It seemed like we were surrounded.


I don't call myself a <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">coward</span></span>, but rather one that 
positions himself away from danger. Seeing all the ruckus and stomps 
from the large foes, I found that going to the now empty cage where the ogre once was
was a really good option. I continued to fire my arrows through the cage bars,
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">how I love being small</span></span> ,
while my companions fought the creatures.


Sure that we could hold the ogre, <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Ranmorr</span></span>
rushed towards one of the duergars in the next room only to be assailed 
by a hidden trap. Our situation was dire, but little by little,
we held our ground until <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span></span> dispatched the last of the duergars.

Many events occurred as we searched the place, found the stolen goods, and fought for our lives 
seeking shelter from a terrible <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">blizzard</span></span>. I am starting to think that the north was not the best place to hide, but hey, we had <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">goat stew</span></span> that night!
