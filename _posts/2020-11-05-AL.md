The lovely town of 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Good Mead</span></span>.
Nice people, good ale, and the perfect place for a 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">retirement</span></span>, 
specially if I can retire as the 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">towns speaker</span></span>.
I'll explain that in a second. 


After many days in the far north, our adventures brought us to Good Mead. 
Rumours were that a giant terrorized the town and stole its ale. 
Deprived of the only thing that could help them survive the cursing winter from 
Auril, it suffices to say that townsfolk were desperate. <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">It's all fun and games till they steal your ale.</span></span>



As usual, 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Magnus</span></span> lead our party through the woods 
in search for the giants. We meet a wandering bladesinger, 
called <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Feagrimnir</span></span> who was also tracking the beasts and he joined our party. 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Sometimes I wonder what rules of thumb should we use when being overly suspicious of a stranger meet alone in the woods or when welcoming them with open arms. </span></span>


Carving our path through the woods, <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span></span> found and set free a fox who 
was trapped in a small wooden cage. The creature would be the dinner of five militia men
who, unfortunately meet their end in the hand of the giants. 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Or'o</span></span> and <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Magnus</span></span> spoke with the creature who gave us directions on 
the giants' den.

We ventured forth just to be meet with war shouts from 
what appeared to be three 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">ogres</span></span> and their guarding animal. 
It is funny what you consider a creature's pet, for us halflings, a ferret is good enough. Want something bigger? A mastiff is terrorizing. I suppose it is only appropriate that an ogre has a 
fucking <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">polar bear</span></span> as a beast.
Well, an adventurers' life ain't supposed to be easy.

Since our adventures in the far north, many of my companions have gotten stronger. 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span></span> uncovered secrets of the artificers 
and had a feline construct by his side, who he commanded to engage the bear. 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Ranmorr</span></span> acquired powerful new spells,
including <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Tasha's Caustic Brew</span></span>, a stream of acid 
that boiled the skin of the ogres. The creatures were outmatched!
Nonetheless, <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Or'o</span></span> intervened when we prepared to take down the polar bear. Magically speaking with the beast, the druid convinced it to retreat into the wilderness. 
I am really impressed by these <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">shepherd</span></span> druids!


Securing the stolen mead, we returned to the town where something, in particular, caught my attention: the town did not have a speaker or mayor. In fact, several influential people were running for speaker. Interesting! Nothing said that the mayor couldn't be the charming rogue who has just saved the town from terrorizing ogres, returning their precious stolen mead in the process. There you have the beginning of my <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">political career</span></span>.

Using his tinkering skills, <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span></span> helped me setting up small magical boxes shouting <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">vote for Redcap!</span></span> and I spent quite a few gold coins investing in my campaign but it would be worth it!
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">What could go wrong?</span></span> If I won for mayor, I would retire as a small halfling. If I lost, all I had to do was to kill the winner and <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">assume his identity</span></span>. I am really looking forward election day!
