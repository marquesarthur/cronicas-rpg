All right ladies and gentlemen, I don't have time for an 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">intermession</span></span> and I am no play-writer though 
some lords of Waterdeep offered me some good coin to embezzle their children deeps not so long ago. 
But anyway, many things have happened since I departed the 
humble town of <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Dougan's Hole</span></span>. Most of them involve deities, 
devils and whatever grand scheme they run behind the scenes of 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Icewind Dale</span></span>.


Some of these events involve my companions, who have been 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">cursed</span></span> while 
others are 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">bad dreams</span></span>
about an army of devils and fire burning down the ten towns. 
We couldn't do much about the latter; honestly, if the fire brought a little 
bit of warmth that would be a change, but we had to seek a holy man 
to lift the curse from my companions.


We heard that a priest of <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Lathander</span></span> lived in the 
city of <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Bryn Shander</span></span> and we sought his assistance. 
The friendly gnome priest, <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Copper Knobberknocker</span></span>
broke the curse without breaking a sweat though he requested us to locate 
his missing friend -- <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Macreadus</span></span> --
in some sort of black cabin in the far north across the 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Lonelywood</span></span>.

What are the odds for Lathander cursing us just so we go to his temple, be in his debt, and so find his missing servant?
</span>

Our journey led us through the Lonelywood indeed. 
On the top of a cliff, we found the 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">black lodge</span></span>
where Macreadus was last seen. It was hanging on the edge of the cliff, and the sight was just outstanding though the silence and chill in the air haunted my bones. Something was amiss.

<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span></span>
and 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Or'o</span></span> -- shapechanged as a huge wolf-spider -- 
were the first to enter de cabin. It was in total chaos with humble 
and debris all over the place; in 
one misstep the old wood cracked over the weight of 
Or'o and he fell through the cliff
as in the old bardic tales 
where
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell</span></span>.
Story tells that Or'o fell to the ground and almost died, but who am I to write such a terrible thing about my druidic friend? Let my journal ~~erroneously~~ accurately tell that he 
shapechanged in a small hummingbird and flew back to us safe and sound.  



After the startle, we found the reason why the cabin was in such a mess.
Some spherical device accidentally laid on the floor. Clear scorch marks radiated from where it was to everywhere else in the cabin and the item was clearly magical.

<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
What could a tinkerer be more happy about? A magical device, supposedly capable of igniting fire?
Wreckage, the artificer, was thrilled!

</div>


We activated the device, which started to float outside the cabin. Its circles started spinning with unimaginable speed and the sphere was as bright and warm as a small sun. 
If Lathander had placed a curse on us so that we could find this device and break the everlasting winter in the land, that was a fair price.
Nonetheless, our excitement lasted as long as how a kobold gets happy seeing tasty food just for four of his siblings eat all of it, leaving the poor bastard nothing but an empty plate...


Auril, the frost maiden herself, laughed at us. With a simple word, 
the device was struck with divine magic and, in the blink of an eye, it was torn apart.
With the snowstorm that hit us, her servants appeared -- commanded by a
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Ice Wraith</span></span>.



We fought. We won. We saw Macreadus's soul meet redemption.
All the way back the wind sounded like 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">chuckles</span></span>
from the frost lady mocking our childish attempt 
to break her curse.
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Yet another lovely day in Icewind Dale!</span></span>
