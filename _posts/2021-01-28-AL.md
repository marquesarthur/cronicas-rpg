Sorry for the long hiatus, I've heard of things called internships and 
grad school and they are indeed a peril.

Following the footsteps of 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">detective Archer</span></span> 
it is time for some 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">noir</span></span> 
writing. 


Looking back at the events that unfolded, it was like seeing this big jigsaw puzzle. 
Little by little, the pieces fit together. Usually you start at the corners, 
unrelated pieces, of different colors and shapes. 
I do remember the duergars' raid at
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Easthaven</span></span> 
and what appeared to be the usual sacking. 
Then, there were the missing magic items also stolen by them at 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Caer-dineval</span></span> 
as well as prophecies spoken by an old dwarven lady about a 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">warlord</span></span> 
deep in the bowls of the earth and his plans to conquer the ten towns.
How these pieces would fit together?


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Chardalyn</span></span> -- 
black corrupted stone used by the wizards of old. This was the missing bit that we would soon uncover
as we traveled further south to free the citizens of 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Good Mead</span></span>
from terrible nightmares. 
Although their peril was not a piece of the jigsaw puzzle, it lead us to an amazing encounter with 
a mindflayer's 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Nautiloid</span></span>,
where a gnomish mindflayer pointed us toward the duergar's fort.

We approached with caution yet the thundering sound coming from the fort's gates caught us unexpectedly. 
Was it an avalanche? It couldn't be, the trained eyes of 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Magnus</span></span>
and
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Or'o</span></span>
would have alerted us of that. We sought shelter for an avalanche that never came.
Instead, we saw 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">it</span></span>
soaring high, the unmistakable shape of a 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">dragon</span></span>
flying towards the ten towns while its master 
patiently waited for the wave of destruction to come under the shelter of his massive fort. 
Little he knew we were coming for him. 


Storming the front gate was our only option and it would be naive to expect such plan 
could break through the massive iron doors that barred our entrance if not by 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Fate</span></span>'s
spell which knocked the door open. 
Fighting duergar through the corridors and passageways had a sense of rush, 
since every step we took into the belly of the beast, the dragon flew close to the ten towns.
Could we defeat the duergar and find a way to command the dragon to return to its lair?


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span></span>, the artificer,
was the first to uncover the nature of the creature. It was as much a dragon as it was a 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">construct</span></span>.
Then, it all made sense, all the chardlyn that the duergar were gathering 
were for the creature's armor while the stolen magic items were what kept the beast *"alive"*.
Its creator, 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Xardorok Sunblight</span></span>
-- the duergar warlord -- was there at the forge, 
griming with malevolence. His smile was the only answer the we got about how to stop his creation.


<div style="text-align:center">

</div>
<br>

It's funny, as well as the cogs and gears moved the construct and all the machinery in the forge, 
so did we. Moving like a <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">well-oiled machine</span></span>
we engaged the warlord and his 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">quaggoth</span></span>
minions, fighting in union and having each others back.
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Kashir</span></span>
threw a fireball and carved a path through the first wave of minions. 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Miri</span></span>,
the barbarian, raged and racked through more minions, while I threw daggers through the air
and 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Or'o</span></span>
summoned beasts to strengthen our numbers.


Xardorok was well prepared to counter our efforts. One of his spells paralyzed one of my companions 
, while another spell made one of my friends' armour heat and burn her alive. We were in dire need of help, but no one would come. How could they? 
We were one of the few that could
defeat the dragon's master in the vain hope of stopping the creature's path of destruction. So we had to find the strength within us to defeat
the duergar forgemaster. 

It was then that we acted as one. 
Wreckage pulled one of his artificer trinkets from his belt, he called it a 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">pistol</span></span>.
One shot from the weapon broke through Xardorok's defenses, and the duergar felt pain.
His quaggoth minions all rushed to take down Wreckage but
but Kashir conjured magical tendrils that kept them at bay meanwhile Miri and I carved a path through more minions to let Wreckage have a clear shot. 
At the same time, Fate uplift spells to improve the artificer's aim
while Magnus' healed our wounds.


And here I chuckle because all I could imagine was what could Xardorok be thinking about as Wreckage's shot pierced through his heart.

<div style="text-align:center">
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Bang bang, he shot me down</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Bang bang, I hit the ground</span></span>
<br>
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;"><span style="color: red;">Bang bang, that awful sound</span></span>
</div>
<br>


The duergar forgemaster was gone. Would his death mean the end of his creation?
We would soon find it out.
