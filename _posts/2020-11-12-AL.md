My life as a smuggler has taught my that the best place to lay low 
are these so-called <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">nowhere</span></span> places.
Any town in the middle of nowhere, 
where no one goes, and the people are dumb enough that they can't even 
formulate a proper question about why where you there. That's 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Dougan's Hole</span></span>.


<div style="text-align:center">

I was <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">grumpy</span></span>, more than the usual for someone under the everlasting winter created by the frost maiden, Auril. I spent the week having terrible headaches and I was not certain if that was 
because I had too much ale in Good Mead; because I had stayed under the same identify for too long; or because of something else. I suppose the headaches were so strong that I ended up developing some weird power -- I could now create <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">spectral knifes</span></span> that could pierce through hide and iron 
and rend the mind of my opponents. While unusual, I have heard of others with similar skills, 
they were called <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">soul knives</span></span>.




The second reason for my grumpiness was that we had traveled to Dougan's Hole to save the weary townsfolk from a pair of wolves terrorizing the city. However, no one gave a shit about the problem. No one cared that the wolves had
ate their livestock or that they had
 kidnapped two kids, not even the kids' parents who were happy that now they had fewer mouths to feed. Even the town's mayor did not offer us any reward for hunting down the wolves. 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">I don't do charity</span></span>, but my companions had much softer hearts and here we were, tracking the beasts.


Visibility was minimal, we could barely see anything when the wolves attacked. 
The snow made them practically invisible to even our trained eyes and the beasts
swoop from banks of soft snow ambushing us.

The creatures were big as horses, 
their fur white as Auril's hair, and their teeth big as my small halfling fingers. 
Our mounts panicked as the creatures circled us laughing and threating our lives with disdain. 
Impressive! They could talk, but none of their words would dissuade us from a good fight, specially the stubborn 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Ranmorr</span></span>.


We fought the creatures in the plain snowfield. 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Or'o</span></span> pulled his mantle away and revealed 
bear tattoos who magically came to life and gave us the animal's endurance. 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Magnus</span></span> demeanor was quite uncommon, 
he kept deliberating whether the creatures were worth of murder in the name of 
his god <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Bhaal</span></span>.
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span></span> shoot bolts from his artificer made crossbow 
while I flew spectral daggers through the battlefield.


<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Feagrimnir</span></span> was the most impressive. 
He taunted the creature asking if it was ever rode to which the winter wolf replied 
never! Laughing, the bladesinger cast a spell that allowed him to jump unimaginable distances and,
in the blink of an eye, he was atop the wolf.


The wolves were defeated, but not before before revealing that the kidnapped kids were kept captive 
at the lair of a <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">frost giant</span></span>. Fighting a giant was no easy task,
fighting a giant for free was even worse. I could only pray that it had a 
 stash filled with goods.


The giant lived in a huge igloo with multiple entrances. Our spellcasters used their familiars to 
scout ahead and through their familiars' eyes, they found the children. The giant was nowhere to be seen and as we quickly freed the kids, an awakened mammoth broke through the place cursing 
a party of <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">adventurers who had killed his master</span></span>.
Indeed, we were adventurers, but at the wrong place at the wrong time.

The mammoth's hide was hard to cut and it trampled through the place making it hard for our spellcasters to properly concentrate. My spectral knives could pierce the creature, but that was not a good idea either. Perceiving me as a threat, the mammoth trampled 
<span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span></span> and <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">Feagrimnir</span></span> who were in the front lines and went direct towards me. The last thing I remember were tusks hitting my frail body.




I woke back in town. We had defeated the wolves and the mammoth. Dougan's hole was safe, but there was little to no gratitude for our deeds. <span style="font-family: 'Julee', cursive;">
<span style="color: red;">I broke the mayor's front door lock</span></span> before leaving. 
Seeing the mayor complaining eased my humor.
