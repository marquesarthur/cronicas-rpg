I was offered to the great white dragon Augaurath. It was the greatest honour among us kobolds.
I was gonna be remembered as a hero—savior of our tribe.
The dragon chuckled at our poor offer, calling me
<span style="color: red;">Not Edible</span>
<br>
But just you wait, just you wait. Augaurath will have 
the tastier meal ever. One day, I'll be like one of these thanksgiving bonanzas.

Mr. <span style="color: red;">Redcap</span> is on a vacation trying to save Good mead. He gave me this tome with some tales. 
I am not sure what to do with it. Is this a recipe book? 

Guess I'm gonna help adventurers make a delicious <span style="color: red;">clam chowder</span>.


## Ingredients

* A party of adventures, preferrably 6 or 7
* An ice <span style="color: red;">mephit</span>
* Four big sharks, portioned in pairs
* Some clams
* Three shipwrecks
* <span style="color: red;">f***ing cold</span> water
* Any other ingredients that go into a clam chowder

## Instructions 

<span style="color: red;">1.</span> First, you need really <span style="color: red;">curious</span> and  <span style="color: red;">bold</span> adventures not afraid of cold water. Make the ice mephit tell then about exploits of gold and magic items in the shipwrecks.
<br>

<span style="color: red;">2.</span> Make sure to have a monk among your party of adventurers, lets name him <span style="color: red;">Leigh</span>. Encouraged by the ice mephit, Leigh dives into the shipwreck to search for treasures. Meanwhile, the other party members might want to tie a rope to the ship's mast and imagine how to safely cross it.
<br>

<span style="color: red;">3.</span> Release your first pair of hungry sharks. Their objective is to chew any party members in the water so that they get super tired and in need of really good clam chowder. When the monk notices he is surrounded by sharks, the other party member should go help him. If you have an artificer, let's say 
<span style="color: red;">Wreckage</span>, you can add some extra flavour if the said artificer slides through a rope in the vain hope of saving Leigh while also stumbling over other party members that are trying to cross that rope and shoving them into the water.
<br>

<span style="color: red;">4.</span> <span style="color: red;">DO NOT</span> kill the party. Some clever ways for them to escape the hungry sharks involve 
a druid,
<span style="color: red;">Or'o</span>, summoning sacrificial animals so the sharks get distracted and can escape the first shipwreck.
<br>

<span style="color: red;">5.</span> Let the party argue for a bit. They should decide if they will attempt a second shipwreck or storm Auril's
<span style="color: red;">skull fortress</span>. If the party leans towards the fortress, make sure that one of the party members -- 
<span style="color: red;">Kravathar</span> -- naively remembers that they have a spell that helps people walk over water.
<br>

<span style="color: red;">6.</span> Emboldened by the new spell. The party attempts the second shipwreck. Nothing impressive here, just a couple of clams. 
They look really <span style="color: red;">tasty</span>. 
<br>

<span style="color: red;">7.</span> Finally, at the last shipwreck, split the party. Splitting the party always brings a lot of spiciness to the dish,
or how we kobolds usually say  <span style="color: red;">Umami</span>. Half the party show stay at a clifftop watching their friends
dive into the <span style="color: red;">f***ing cold</span> water one last time. Wait a couple of minutes while the curious adventurers move towards their peril.
<br>

<span style="color: red;">8.</span> Release your second pair of <span style="color: red;">sharks</span>. 
Preferably, super hungry and bad sharks. They will chop a few chunks of the party members who are in the water.


Swimming away from the sharks back to shore, the members on the clifftop watch in dread. Some, as myself, 
try to find a long-range weapon just to remember that they don't have one. 

Remember! One of the biggest things for cooking the right meal is set up, <span style="color: red;">Mise en place</span> in old draconic. Always organize and arrange your equipment before an adventure or you will find yourself in dire need of a crossbow or a longbow as I was—shame on me.

Back to the swimming party. At this point, you should barely see them as the water is full of blood, and they are at death's door. 
Miraculously, they escape. 
<br>

<span style="color: red;">9.</span>The <span style="color: red;">exhausted</span> party realizes that sight-seeing shipwrecks was not a good idea.
In dire need of resting, they should take out one of the scavenged clams and cook a delicious clam chowder.
<br>

<span style="color: red;">10.</span>Enjoy your meal

## Notes

Be careful about step <span style="color: red;">6</span>, a lot of beginners erroneously release the second pair of sharks at this step.
If you do that, there is a huge risk that the sharks might kill whoever is underwater trying to grab the clams for the chowder. 
If you do that, you have ruined your dish.
