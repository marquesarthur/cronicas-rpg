abstract: The city guard looked about uneasily. Was he seeing things or did a stealthy figure just duck behind that pillar? Suddenly, a dart like object hit the guard in the throat and even as he fell, a figure slipped through the entrance into the treasure room.

## Steady Aim

<i class="ra ra-targeted"></i> Starting at **3rd level**, attacking at long range with a weapon with the light and throwing properties doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.


Additionally, you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.

___

## Whisper Knife

<i class="ra ra-daggers"></i> When you choose this archetype at **3rd level**, you learn the secret magic that makes the weapons of the whispering knives so deadly.

You magically attune to up to four weapons in your possession with the light and throwing properties. The weapon damage dice increases to a d6 and, whenever you throw them, the weapon dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, the weapon reapears in their sheaths.


You can absorb the properties of one one-handed Magic Weapon by performing a special ritual while you study the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. At the end of the ritual, the original weapon is destroyed and any of your whisper knives have the magical properties of the absorbed magic weapon. You canâ€™t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. 
Whenever you absorb a new item, the properties of the previous one cease to exist.

## Pierce the Veil

<i class="ra ra-player-teleport"></i> Like a ghost, you have the ability to slip in and out of the Ethereal Plane. 

Starting at the **9th level**, you can use your cunning action in your first turn of a combat to cast the blink spell. 


You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.


___

## Deadly Reflexes

<i class="ra ra-hood"></i> Starting at **13th level**, you have mastered the art of knife throwing. As a reaction to an enemy moving towards you, you may make a ranged weapon attack. If the attack hits, you may acrobatically tumble 10 feet away from the enemy without provoking an attack of opportunity. Even in the etheral plane, you can still use this class feature and affect creatures in the material plane, as your thrown knifes pierce the veil between the two planes.

You can use this feature a number of times equals to your Dexterity modifier.
You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

___


## Knife Barrage

<i class="ra ra-kunai"></i> By **17th leve**l, when you use the Attack action and make a ranged attack with a one handed weapon, make one additional attack. You automatically draw a throwing weapon for this extra attack.
